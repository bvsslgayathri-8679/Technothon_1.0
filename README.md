**Solution provided:** 
There are already various devices available but most of them are not cost effective and the size factor is also problematic.
So our team has decided to make a model which is both cost effective and has minimum size . It can be connected to the Android app to detect the misplaced items using Motion based sensor and Global Positioning System.
This Memory tag component allows an Arduino board to connect to the internet.
It allows the objects to be detected and controlled remotely across the existing network ,hence making things simple and time conserving.


**Real Time usage:** This real time projects include IEEE standard-based that produce real-time services. For instance, there are different devices available but they are somewhat not cost effective and their size factor was not upto the mark.So our team decided to make a model whch is cost effective and is  miniature and connect to the android app to discover the lost item.

**Example:** This can be  used to find out the lost items small objects like Rings, Specs, watches or anything you feel it's valuable etc

The major challenges that we ran into were-
1)Designing the Circuit Model was difficult and made complicated
2)Make the page responsive was another task that made us difficult

How we solved
We tried to explore the problems by ourselves and we're able to solve
